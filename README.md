# About ModernCLI

This is a package to collect and centralize testing for many inline header
libraries I had written and then duplicated in other packages.  These headers
are being gathered under a common package that can then be vendored or use
moderncli as a core dependency.  Hence, one interpretation for for this package
is "Modern C++" Library Interfaces.
